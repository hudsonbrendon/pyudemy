# Quick start

```bash
$ pip install pyudemy
```
or

```bash
$ python setup.py install

# Authentication

To make any calls to Udemy REST API, you will need to create an API client. API client consists of a bearer token, which is connected to a user account on Udemy.

If you want to create an API client, [Sign up on udemy.com](https://www.udemy.com/join/) and go to API Clients page in your user profile. Once your API client request is approved, your newly created [API client](https://www.udemy.com/user/edit-api-clients/) will be active and your bearer token will be visible on [API Clients](https://www.udemy.com/user/edit-api-clients/) page.
